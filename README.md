## Notes

The number on top helps you keep track of your score and does literally nothing else.

Is the game a fun way to pass the time? Maybe. Is it a complete waste of your time? Most definitely. But the code behind it is dope, I promise. Especially that one function.

Okay okay I know my code is supposed to be dry alright. Get off my back mom. It'll be fixed by the end of the week.
